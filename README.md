## 🧮 GLFT Strategy Theory

The **Guéant-Lehalle-Fernandez-Tapia (GLFT) model** is a continuous-time optimal market-making framework that maximizes expected utility while managing inventory risk. The strategy optimally balances profit generation with inventory control through mathematically derived bid-ask spreads.

### Core Principles

1. **Optimal Pricing**: Bid-ask spreads are calculated to maximize expected profit given market conditions
2. **Inventory Aversion**: Positions create price skews to encourage mean-reverting trades
3. **Risk Management**: Parameters adapt to volatility to maintain consistent risk exposure
4. **Market Microstructure**: Accounts for order flow, adverse selection, and market impact

### Academic Foundation

- **Original Paper**: "Dealing with the Inventory Risk: A Solution to the Market Making Problem" (Guéant, Lehalle, Fernandez-Tapia, 2013)
- **Citation**: Over 300 citations in quantitative finance literature
- **Industry Adoption**: Used by major HFT firms and institutional market makers

## 📐 Mathematical Model

### Core GLFT Components

The strategy calculates optimal quotes using two fundamental components:

#### Component c₁ (Optimal Spread Base)
```
c₁ = (1 / (ξ × Δ)) × ln(1 + (ξ × Δ) / k)
```

#### Component c₂ (Volatility Scaling Factor)
```
c₂ = √(γ / (2 × a × Δ × k)) × (1 + (ξ × Δ) / k)^((k/(ξ×Δ)) + 0.5)
```

#### Parameters
- **a**: Order intensity (adaptive, base = 0.15)
- **k**: Inventory sensitivity (adaptive, base = 11)  
- **γ**: Risk aversion coefficient (1.5)
- **ξ**: Inventory penalty coefficient (3)
- **Δ**: Time step normalization (1.0)

### Spread and Skew Calculation

#### Base Half-Spread
```
δ_base = c₁ + (Δ/2) × σ × c₂
```

#### Inventory Skew
```
skew = σ × c₂ × (q/q_max) × INVENTORY_FACTOR × time_multiplier
```

#### Final Spread with Position Expansion
```
δ_final = δ_base × (1 + |q/q_max| × POSITION_SPREAD_EXPANSION)
```

### Quote Generation

#### Bid-Ask Prices
```
P_bid = S - δ_final - skew
P_ask = S + δ_final - skew
```

Where:
- **S**: Fair price (mid-market)
- **σ**: Adaptive volatility (EWMA)
- **q**: Current inventory position
- **q_max**: Maximum allowed position

### Volatility Modeling

#### EWMA Variance Update
```
σ²_t = λ × σ²_{t-1} + (1-λ) × r²_t
```

#### Shock Detection
```
shock_intensity = |r_t| / σ_t
shock_multiplier = min(2.5, 1 + max(0, shock_intensity - 0.8) × 0.5)
```

Where:
- **r_t**: Log return at time t
- **λ**: EWMA decay parameter (0.8)
- **Shock threshold**: 0.8 standard deviations

## 🚀 Advanced Features

### 1. Temporal Position Decay

Positions held for extended periods face increasing urgency to close, simulating realistic trader behavior.

```python
# Time-based enhancement multiplier
time_progress = min(1.0, time_in_position / (20 * 60))  # 20 minutes
time_multiplier = 1.0 + time_progress * 3.0  # Up to 4x enhancement
```

### 2. "Thousand Cuts" Loss Protection

Prevents gradual capital erosion by enhancing position-closing urgency during accumulated losses.

```python
# Loss-based enhancement
if unrealized_pnl < 0:
    loss_ratio = abs(unrealized_pnl) / position_value
    loss_multiplier = 1.0 + min(1.0, loss_ratio / 0.005)  # 0.5% threshold
```

### 3. Z-Score Volume Adaptation

Dynamically adjusts order sizes based on recent price momentum to capitalize on trend reversals.

```python
# Price momentum Z-score
z_score = log_return / √(ewma_variance)

# Volume adjustment based on direction
if z_score > threshold:
    # Price moved up → boost ASK volume, reduce BID volume
    ask_volume *= (1 + |z_score| * boost_factor)
    bid_volume *= max(min_multiplier, 1 - |z_score| * reduce_factor)
```

### 4. Adaptive Update Frequency

Trading frequency adjusts to market conditions - higher volatility and larger positions trigger more frequent updates.

```python
# Activity-based frequency scaling
vol_factor = (current_volatility / base_volatility) ** 0.6
position_factor = 1.0 + abs(position_ratio) * 0.3
shock_factor = shock_multiplier ** 0.8

# Inverse relationship: higher activity → shorter intervals
new_frequency = base_frequency / (vol_factor * position_factor * shock_factor)
```
